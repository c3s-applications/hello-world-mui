In WestFalia weather centre, born and raised

On the CDS was where I spent most of my days

Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin', all cool

And all plottin' some temperatures outside of the school

When a couple of data points who were up to no good

Started making trouble in my correlation

I got in one little regression and my mom got scared

She said, "You're movin' to JS react app deployed with kubernetes"
